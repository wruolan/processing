I am a coding exercise 

by Ruolan Wu

used in IML 288: Introduction to Creative Coding under Professor Jeanne Jo in the Media Arts and Practice Division

to create a 2-scene experimental video that changes every 5 seconds and loops!

//

You view the scenery 

through a window frame 

on an application window

through a device screen.
